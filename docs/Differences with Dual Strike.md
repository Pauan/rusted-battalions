## Bridges

Bridges now count as roads, which means that Koal benefits from them.


## Transports

Transport units (APC, T Copter, Lander, and Black Boat) are allowed to load/unload an
unlimited number of times per turn. In AWBW this is called "transport boosting".

Without transport boosting there is very little reason to make transports, and even with
boosting transports are still pretty bad.


## Bad luck COs

Some COs (Flak, Jugger, and Sonja) have bad luck.

Advance Wars rolls 2 numbers, 1 number for the good luck, and 1 number for the bad luck, and then subtracts them.

This means that good luck tends to cancel out bad luck, and bad luck tends to cancel out good luck, so the
end result is that Flak / Jugger / Sonja tend to have very average luck.

But the entire point of COs like Flak / Jugger is that they're supposed to have wildly varying luck, not
average luck!

So Rusted Battalions works differently. Instead of rolling 2 numbers and cancelling them out, Rusted
Battalions just rolls 1 number to determine the luck value.

So for example, Flak has +15% good luck and -10% bad luck. Rusted Battalions will roll a number from
-10 to +15 and that will be the luck for that attack.

This means that the bad luck COs have more variability with their attacks, even though they have the same
luck stats from Advance Wars.
